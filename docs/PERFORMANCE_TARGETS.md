# Performance Targets - Phase 12: Production Readiness

This document defines the performance targets and benchmarks for the Cogniverse multi-modal RAG system.

## Latency Targets by Modality

Each modality has specific latency targets based on the complexity of processing and expected user tolerance.

| Modality | P95 Target | P99 Target | Justification |
|----------|------------|------------|---------------|
| **TEXT** | < 100ms | < 150ms | Simple keyword/semantic search, fast retrieval |
| **DOCUMENT** | < 200ms | < 300ms | Text extraction + semantic search, moderate complexity |
| **IMAGE** | < 500ms | < 750ms | Vision model inference + embedding search |
| **VIDEO** | < 500ms | < 750ms | Frame extraction + vision processing + search |
| **AUDIO** | < 1000ms | < 1500ms | Audio transcription + semantic search |

### Measurement Guidelines

- **Latency**: Measured from query submission to result return
- **Includes**: Routing, agent execution, result aggregation, reranking
- **Excludes**: Network transit time, client rendering
- **Test Environment**: Local deployment, no network latency

## Throughput Targets

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Queries Per Second (QPS)** | â‰¥ 100 QPS | Concurrent asyncio requests |
| **Concurrent Requests** | â‰¥ 500 | Stress test with 500 simultaneous queries |
| **Sustained Load** | â‰¥ 90 QPS for 60s | Continuous request generation |
| **Success Rate** | â‰¥ 95% | Percentage of successful completions |

### Load Test Scenarios

1. **Burst Load**: 200 requests in < 2 seconds (100+ QPS)
2. **Stress Test**: 500 concurrent requests with < 5% failures
3. **Sustained Load**: 60 seconds continuous load at 90+ QPS
4. **Mixed Modality**: Even distribution across TEXT/DOCUMENT/VIDEO modalities

## Cache Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Cache Hit Rate** | â‰¥ 30% | Percentage of queries served from cache |
| **Cache TTL** | 1 hour (3600s) | Default time-to-live for cached results |
| **Cache Size per Modality** | 1000 entries | LRU cache capacity |
| **Cache Lookup Latency** | < 1ms | Average time for cache check |

### Cache Effectiveness Metrics

- **Hit Rate by Modality**: Track separately per modality (TEXT, VIDEO, etc.)
- **Repeated Query Benefit**: Cached queries should be â‰¥ 10x faster
- **Memory Footprint**: Monitor total cache memory usage

## Multi-Agent Performance

| Metric | Target | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Parallel Execution Speedup** | â‰¥ 2x | Improvement over sequential execution |
| **Max Concurrent Agents** | 10 | Semaphore limit for resource control |
| **Agent Timeout** | 30s per agent | Maximum execution time before timeout |
| **Error Isolation** | 100% | One agent failure doesn't crash others |

## Resource Utilization

| Resource | Target | Measurement |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **CPU Utilization** | < 70% avg | Under normal load (100 QPS) |
| **Memory Usage** | < 4GB | Total process memory |
| **Cache Memory** | < 500MB | All modality caches combined |
| **Thread Pool** | â‰¤ 20 threads | Maximum concurrent executor threads |

## Optimization Impact

### Per-Modality Model Training

| Metric | Target | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Accuracy Improvement** | â‰¥ 5% | Per-modality routing accuracy gain |
| **Training Time** | < 30 min | Time to train modality-specific model |
| **Model Size** | < 100MB | Per-modality model storage |
| **Inference Overhead** | < 10ms | Additional latency from modality model |

### Expected Improvements

- **Baseline Routing Accuracy**: ~80% (base DSPy model)
- **With Modality-Specific Models**: ~85%+ per modality
- **Overall System Accuracy**: ~90% with cross-modal optimization

## Performance Degradation Alerts

| Alert | Threshold | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **High Latency** | P95 > 2x target | Investigate slow queries, check caches |
| **Low Cache Hit Rate** | < 20% | Review query patterns, adjust TTL |
