# Deploy Modal VLM Service for Video Processing

This guide walks you through deploying the Modal VLM service for image description generation in your video processing pipeline.

**Note**: There's also an automated setup script available at `docs/modal/setup_modal_vlm.py` that handles all these steps automatically.

## Prerequisites

1. **Modal Account**: Sign up at [modal.com](https://modal.com) if you don't have an account
2. **Modal CLI**: Install the Modal Python package

```bash
pip install modal
```

3. **Authentication**: Set up Modal authentication

```bash
modal setup
```

## Step 1: Deploy the Modal VLM Service

Deploy the VLM service to Modal:

```bash
modal deploy scripts/modal_vlm_service.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Download and cache the Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct model
- ✅ Create a serverless GPU-accelerated inference service
- ✅ Return a web endpoint URL for API access

## Step 2: Get Your Endpoint URL

After deployment, Modal will provide an endpoint URL that looks like:
```
https://username--cogniverse-vlm-vlmmodel-generate-description.modal.run
```

**Copy this URL** - you'll need it for the next step.

## Step 3: Update Configuration

Edit your `config.json` file and replace the placeholder:

```json
{
  "vlm_endpoint_url": "https://your-actual-vlm-endpoint-url-here"
}
```

## Step 4: Test the Integration

Test that everything works:

```bash
# Test just the Modal service
modal run scripts/modal_vlm_service.py --image-path /path/to/test/image.jpg

# Test the full pipeline integration
python test_fix.py
```

## Step 5: Run Video Processing

Now your video processing pipeline will use Modal instead of Ollama:

```bash
python scripts/test_video_processing.py
```

## Expected Benefits

✅ **Better Reliability**: No local Ollama service dependencies  
✅ **GPU Acceleration**: Fast inference on Modal's L40S/A100 GPUs  
✅ **Scalability**: Handles multiple videos concurrently  
✅ **Quality**: Qwen2-VL-7B produces high-quality descriptions  

## Troubleshooting

### "VLM endpoint not configured" error
- Ensure you've deployed the service: `modal deploy scripts/modal_vlm_service.py`
- Check that `config.json` has the correct endpoint URL
- Verify the endpoint is working: `curl -X POST your-endpoint-url -d '{"frame_base64":"..."}'`

### GPU/Memory errors
- Try reducing GPU type in `modal_vlm_service.py`: Change `GPU_TYPE = "l40s"` to `"t4"`
- Reduce batch size or concurrent requests

### Authentication errors
- Run `modal setup` again to refresh credentials
- Check your Modal account has sufficient credits

## Cost Estimation

- **Cold start**: ~10-15 seconds (first request after idle)
- **Warm inference**: ~2-4 seconds per image
- **Cost**: ~$0.01-0.05 per image (depending on GPU type)

For our elephant_dream_clip test (719 frames):
- **Total cost**: ~$7-35
- **Processing time**: ~25-50 minutes (including cold starts)

## Scaling Configuration

For high-volume processing, adjust these settings in `scripts/modal_vlm_service.py`:

```python
# More aggressive scaling
@modal.concurrent(max_inputs=100)  # Increase concurrent requests

# Faster GPUs
GPU_TYPE = "a100-80gb"  # or "h100" for maximum speed

# Longer warm periods
scaledown_window=60 * MINUTES  # Keep warm longer
```
